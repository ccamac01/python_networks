This repository is a collection of code that I am writing in Python
as I learn to network program with Python. I will also include notes in the README about topics that are new to me or that I found very interesting. 

Filename: cid-v1.py (short for "comp index downloader version 1")
Purpose: takes a COMP course number as an argument, 
	 returns the COMP{course_number} index.html page
	 from the cs.tufts.edu server,
	 cid-v1.py uses urllib to make the request to the server

Filename: cid-v2.py (short for "comp index downloader version 2")
Purpose: takes a COMP course number as an argument, 
	 returns the COMP{course_number} index.html page
	 from the cs.tufts.edu server,
	 cid-v2.py uses sockets to create a TCP connection with the
	 server, sends a GET request and receives the contents of
	 the webpage
